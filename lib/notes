# For this project I am going to build a Command Line Interface application that takes in the users mood 
based off the array of moods I build in which is their main menu and my program will give them a playlist reccommendation based on their mood 


#Things this application must do == Welcome the user
#ask for their mood based on given options
#return a list of atleast 10 songs based on the mood they choose
#possibly show the artist of the songs as well


#proposed classes 
#CLI class - basically the application , this is respondsible for everything the user will see on their screen
# API Class - where the data lives , basically this is the place that gives us the info or specific playlist based on the mood the user chooses
# moods class - holds the choices of mood or the main menu


#important things to remember 
# the mood has many songs , the songs belong to the mood yet the mood is associated  with the artist or even the user

#to run the app == bin/run.rb

#Biggest challenges will be 
#1 figuring out which API to users
#2 figuring out how to connect an API - lol thank God there are videos out there
#3 figuring out how to get the exact information needed from the API
#4 figuring out how to diplay the moods and how to handle  bad input 
#5 making sure that I know enough to pass the review and be ble to possibly refractor my code if need be
