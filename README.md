# Musictherapy

For this project I am going to built a Command Line Interface application that takes in the users mood and based off their mood which is picked from their main menu of moods. My program will give them a playlist reccommendation based on their mood. Then if the user wants more info about the song they can select the song and my program will tell them the artist and or genre.

Things this application must do == 
#Welcome the user
#ask for their mood based on given options
#return a list of atleast 10 songs based on the mood they choose
#show the artist of the songs as well as the genre 




## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'musictherapy'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install musictherapy
