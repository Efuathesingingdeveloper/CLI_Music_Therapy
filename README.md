# MusicalBrain

For this project I built a Command Line Interface application based on the Genius API. The app  ask the user if they would like to use my app , then they can type in any artist and get a list of the songs by that artist then they can pick a song from the list and get the lyrics for that song in their browser! 

Things this application must do == 
#Welcome the user
#ask if they want to use my app, ask for an artist, gives them suggestions
#returns a list of artist songs then the lyrics




## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'musical brain'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:
